# NoSurfTube

The YouTube suggestion algorithm is too good at recommending related videos that pique my interest.

## Installation

Currently, the extension is not available on the Chrome Store to download, so it must be cloned from the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Spiderpig86/NoSurfTube.git
```

Then, open Chrome and ensure that [developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq) is enabled on Chrome.

After that, open `chrome://extensions` and click `Load Unpacked`. Select the folder you cloned prior to install the extension.

## How To Use

Once installed, the extension will automatically block suggested videos throughout YouTube.
